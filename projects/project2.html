          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Rough Patch</strong> is a fast-paced top-down action game set in a haunted dollhouse. Trapped inside,
            players must fight through waves of possessed teddy bears, navigate deadly traps, and confront a powerful final boss
            in order to escape. The game blends tight, responsive combat with tense environmental hazards to create a uniquely
            eerie and challenging experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developed as a collaborative college project with <strong>Matt Sinclair</strong> and <strong>Vannia Ung</strong>,
            Rough Patch showcases our combined creative and technical strengths. I was responsible for programming, composing
            the soundtrack, and co-leading level design. Matt focused on core gameplay systems and room layouts, while Vannia
            crafted the original art and brought the dollhouse to life through character and environment design.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            Rough Patch was built to explore how tone and tension can elevate moment-to-moment gameplay. The game‚Äôs dollhouse
            setting allowed us to mix childhood imagery with horror elements, creating a play space that feels both whimsical
            and unsettling. Each room was designed to feel like a trap‚Äîpushing the player to move decisively and stay alert.
          </p>
          <p>
            I coded player controls, enemy behaviors, collision systems, and environmental hazards in Unity, aiming for tight,
            responsive feel similar to classic top-down action games. Level pacing was a core focus: we arranged rooms to
            alternate between frantic battles and quieter navigation segments to maintain a sense of rhythm and momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original soundtrack builds tension using toy-like instruments and discordant melodies, further emphasizing the
            game‚Äôs surreal tone. Syncing visual cues with music shifts was key to selling both danger and relief during
            gameplay.
