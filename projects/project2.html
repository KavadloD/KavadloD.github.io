          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Rough Patch</strong> is a fast-paced top-down action game set in a haunted dollhouse. Trapped inside,
            players must fight through waves of possessed teddy bears, navigate deadly traps, and confront a powerful boss
            to escape. The game blends responsive combat with environmental hazards to create an eerie and challenging
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developed as a collaborative college project with <strong>Matt Sinclair</strong> and <strong>Vannia Ung</strong>,
            Rough Patch showcases our combined creative and technical strengths. I was responsible for programming, composing
            the soundtrack, and co-leading level design. Matt focused on core gameplay systems and room layouts, while Vannia
            brought the dollhouse to life through character and environment art.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            The dollhouse setting gave us the chance to mix childhood imagery with horror elements, creating a space that feels
            both whimsical
            and unsettling. Each room was designed to push the player to move decisively and stay alert.
          </p>
          <p>
            I coded player controls, enemy behaviors, collision systems, and environmental hazards in Unity, aiming for a tight,
            responsive feel
            like classic top-down action games. Level layout was a big focus, with rooms arranged to alternate between frantic
            battles and quieter navigation segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The soundtrack was designed to match the game's creepy-but-fast-paced energy, combining driving percussion with uneasy
            synths. It adds a sense of momentum to combat while keeping the atmosphere tense and slightly eerie.
