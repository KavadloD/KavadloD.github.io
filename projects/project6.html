          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Saplink</strong> is a hybrid puzzle-platformer created in under 48 hours for <strong>Global Game Jam
              2023</strong>. Based on the theme <em>‚ÄúRoots‚Äù</em>, the game follows <strong>Seedboy</strong>, a curious little
            sprout on a journey of growth through layered challenges that shift between surface and underground gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game was developed by a team of eight from the <strong>Maryville Game Developers Club</strong>. At the time, I
            was vice president and helped lead the project from start to finish. It was one of our most collaborative efforts,
            bringing together designers, programmers, artists, and writers in a fast-paced creative setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the surface, Saplink plays like a classic platformer where you jump between ledges, avoid hazards, and explore
            nature-inspired levels. At key moments, you can dig into the ground, switching to a snake-style
              mini-game where you guide roots through narrow soil tunnels to unlock new areas.

            <li>Run and jump through above-ground levels as Seedboy.</li>
            <li>Interact with root points to dig into the earth and enter root mode.</li>
            <li>Guide your roots through a snake-like mini-game to reach the goal.</li>

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            Saplink was developed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2023 by a team of eight from the Maryville Game Developers
            Club. I worked on programming, level design, and gameplay flow, and helped shape the overall vision as vice
            president. Our goal was to explore the ‚ÄúRoots‚Äù theme through both mechanics and narrative by connecting surface
            exploration with underground segments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contrast between styles gave us room to experiment with visuals and mechanics while keeping the player focused
            on Seedboy‚Äôs quest. The result is a short but polished game that mixes charm and challenge.
