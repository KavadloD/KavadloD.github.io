          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Saplink</strong> is a hybrid puzzle-platformer created in under 48 hours for <strong>Global Game Jam 2023</strong>. Based on the theme <em>‚ÄúRoots,‚Äù</em> the game follows <strong>Seedboy</strong>‚Äîa curious little sprout on a journey of growth through layered challenges that shift between surface and underground gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game was developed by a team of eight members from the <strong>Maryville Game Developers Club</strong>. At the time, I served as vice-president and helped lead the project from start to finish. It was one of our most collaborative efforts‚Äîbringing together designers, programmers, artists, and writers in a fast-paced creative environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the surface, Saplink plays like a classic platformer: jump between ledges, avoid hazards, and explore nature-inspired levels. But at key points, you can dig into the earth, transforming the game into a <strong>snake-style mini-game</strong> where you guide growing roots through tight soil tunnels to unlock new areas above.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dual gameplay loop creates a rhythm of exploration and focus, blending two distinct styles into one cohesive experience. Each successful underground path helps Seedboy grow‚Äîboth physically and narratively.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            Saplink was developed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2023 by a team of eight from the Maryville Game Developers Club. I contributed to programming, level design, and gameplay flow, and helped guide the overall vision in my role as vice-president. Our goal was to explore the jam‚Äôs ‚ÄúRoots‚Äù theme in both a mechanical and narrative sense‚Äîlinking surface exploration with underground growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transition between platforming and root-growing was key to the experience. We focused on pacing: letting players breathe and explore above ground, then slow down and concentrate in the underground challenges. Each system informed the other, creating satisfying progress moments when a completed root path opened the way forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contrast in styles gave us room to experiment visually and mechanically while keeping the player grounded in Seedboy‚Äôs goal: to grow and move forward. The end result is a short but polished game that blends charm, challenge, and a creative twist on classic mechanics.
