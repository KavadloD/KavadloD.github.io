          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Darkest Place</strong> is a first-person dungeon crawler where players explore a mysterious maze-like
            dungeon, collect weapons, and face off in turn-based battles. Exploration takes place in a 3D environment with
            stylized 2D sprites, blending a dark atmosphere with classic RPG charm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Battles are quirky and unconventional, featuring bizarre and humorous enemies. Instead of relying solely on combat,
            players can talk their way out of fights by choosing the right sequence of actions to pacify enemies. Some
            encounters require experimentation, memory, and empathy rather than brute force.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Darkest Place</strong> was designed to play with tone, mixing eerie dungeon exploration with absurd and
            whimsical enemy interactions. The contrast between gloomy environments and silly monsters creates a sense of
            intrigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the soundtrack, I aimed to make the dungeon music eerie and unsettling, while the battle music is fun, upbeat,
            and bombastic.
          </p>
          <p>
            This solo project was developed entirely by me in Unity. I created the code, pixel art, animations, UI, and original
            music. The core systems include a first-person movement controller, turn-based battle system, branching dialogue
            mechanics, and dynamic state transitions based on player choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            One encounter features Skullion, a giggling plant creature. Telling him a joke gets a small chuckle, but he asks if
            you‚Äôve got anything better. Try again with a second, funnier joke and he bursts into laughter, toppling over and
            revealing his weak spot on his underside. At that point, using <em>Pet</em> tickles him and instantly ends the
            battle. Attempting to pet him too early just makes him uncomfortable but offers a hint about where his weak spot is.
            Watering him boosts his attack, and questioning him gets nothing but indifference. Each step rewards
            persistence and observation.
