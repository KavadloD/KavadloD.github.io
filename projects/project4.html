          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Ha! Potato</strong> is a chaotic, voice-controlled party game created for the 2024 Global Game Jam
            by the
            Maryville Game Developers Club. Inspired by the theme <em>‚ÄúMake Me Laugh,‚Äù</em>&nbsp;the game pits players
            against a
            rapid-fire series of voice-based microgames where your only input is a microphone!
          </p>
          <p>
            As club president, I led the game‚Äôs design, ideation, and programming. Built in just 3 days, the project
            draws
            from the fast-paced WarioWare formula, with a twist: every action must be performed using your voice.
            Whether you have to get loud, stay quiet, or say the correct phrase,
            each challenge is a race against the clock. After each round,
            the mic is passed to the next player like a game of hot potato. You don't want the timer to end on your turn
            ‚Äî or you're out!

            <li>Plug in a microphone ‚Äî your voice is the only controller.</li>

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Ha! Potato</strong> was designed around spontaneity, quick thinking, and laughter. The goal was to
            create
            something anyone could jump into and instantly understand when playing for the first time. I had a lot of
            fun
            composing short 5‚Äì10 second loops for each microgame.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a team of about five artists and three
            programmers, each artist took on one or two microgames to illustrate using just a few simple frames. This
            approach
            let us build a lot of unique minigames fairly quickly, then focus on wiring up the main mechanics. I
            developed the
            voice input
            system to detect volume and pitch thresholds, mapping those to game-specific actions. Each microgame was
            designed to
            be
            quick and intuitive, only requiring a single voice input ‚Äî whether you're blowing into the mic to extinguish
            a
            birthday candle or shouting to
            fire a laser as (royalty-free) Godzilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game uses Unity‚Äôs built-in Windows Speech API via the <code>KeywordRecognizer</code> class, letting us
            map voice
            commands directly to actions without external libraries. This kept development lightweight and well-suited
            for a game jam,
            though it limited the game to run only on Windows devices. Since the system only listens for specific
            phrases, we designed our
            challenges around short, distinct words like ‚Äúcheese,‚Äù ‚Äúgood dog,‚Äù or ‚Äústop‚Äù to ensure clear recognition.
            While this limited the input
            complexity, it made interactions fast, funny, and accessible.
