            <strong>Face the Music</strong> is a rhythm-based action game developed as the capstone project for my B.A.
            in Game
            Design. I led the project‚Äôs design and programming, composed the full original soundtrack, and illustrated
            all of the
            game‚Äôs art. Built in Unity with FMOD integration, the game synchronizes beat-driven combat mechanics to an
            8-bit score.

            The evil sorcerer Latido has seized the legendary Baton of Bewitchment, using its dark powers to control an
            army of music-based minions! As the courageous knight Sir Doremi, you must battle through waves of
            rhythm-powered enemies and put an end to Latido‚Äôs reign.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            Face the Music was designed with a focus on responsive, music-driven gameplay. Using FMOD, I implemented
            beat-perfect synchronization between audio and mechanics, ensuring that all player actions and enemy spawns
            align with the rhythm. Notes are spawned based on a custom timing file, parsed at runtime and matched to the
            soundtrack using Unity‚Äôs timing system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scoring system rewards precision by distinguishing between ‚ÄúMiss,‚Äù ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù hits based on
            the
            player‚Äôs
            timing and positioning. Players can switch lanes to intercept enemies and use two inputs: one to block and
            one to
            strike. This encourages fast, reactive, and skill-based gameplay. Each enemy type is tied to a specific
            action,
            reinforcing
            pattern recognition and rhythm mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enemy types and lane positions are randomized with each run, making every attempt feel different, even on
            the same
            level. This keeps the experience fresh and pushes players to refine their skill instead of relying on
            memorization.
          </p>
