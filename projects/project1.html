          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Face the Music</strong> is a rhythm-based action game developed as the capstone project for my B.A.
            in Game Design. Created as a solo project, I designed and programmed the game, composed the music, and
            illustrated all of the art. Built in Unity with FMOD integration, the game synchronizes gameplay to music,
            blending classic fantasy themes with beat-driven combat mechanics.

            The evil sorcerer Latido has seized the legendary Baton of Bewitchment, using its dark powers to control an
            army of music-based minions! As the courageous knight Sir Doremi, you must battle through waves of
            rhythm-powered enemies and put an end to Latido‚Äôs reign.

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            Face the Music was designed with a focus on responsive, music-driven gameplay. Using FMOD, I implemented
            beat-perfect synchronization between audio and mechanics, ensuring that all player actions and enemy spawns
            align with the rhythm. Notes are spawned based on a custom timing file, parsed at runtime and matched to the
            soundtrack using Unity‚Äôs timing system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scoring system rewards precision, distinguishing between ‚ÄúMiss‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù hits depending on
            the player‚Äôs timing and positioning. Players can switch lanes to intercept enemies and use two inputs to
            either block or strike, encouraging reactive and skill-based play.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reinforce the musical theme, I created dynamic feedback systems such as animated attack/defense cues,
            rhythm-synced particle effects, and real-time score visuals. Each enemy type corresponds to a specific
            action, promoting pattern recognition and beat mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both enemy types and lane positions are randomized each run, ensuring that every attempt‚Äîeven on the same
            level‚Äîfeels unique. This keeps the experience fresh and pushes players to refine their timing rather than
            rely on memorization.
          </p>
