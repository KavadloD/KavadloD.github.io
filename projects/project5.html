          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Squash, The Bug</strong> is a fast-paced platformer built for the <strong>Out of a Hat Jam</strong>, a game
            jam I organized and hosted as president of Maryville University’s Game Design Club. Participants were challenged to
            randomly draw a mechanic, genre, and visual style from a hat to inspire their projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team pulled <em>Spin Dash</em> as the mechanic, <em>Platformer</em> as the genre, and <em>Arts & Crafts</em> as
            the visual style. The result was a vibrant platformer where you play as a
            tiny beetle named Squash!. Squash can roll into a ball and launch forward with momentum, smashing through
            obstacles and enemies across a world made of cardboard, paper, and ink.

            <li>Use arrow keys to run and jump through platforming challenges.</li>
            <li>Press <strong>Shift</strong> to roll up into a ball and launch forward with your spin dash ability.</li>
            <li>Roll through levels and bounce off enemies using speed and momentum.</li>

          <h3>Design Highlights</h3>
          <p>
            I designed and led the jam, contributed to level building, and helped develop the game’s core systems in Unity. With
            a one-week deadline, we focused on a tight gameplay loop and a strong visual identity. The
            handcrafted art direction made everything come together, from ink-drawn hazards to construction-paper
            platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The spin dash mechanic served as the centerpiece for level design, encouraging players to build speed and smash
            through enemies or chain jumps across hazards. We leaned into momentum-based movement to make Squash feel fast and
            satisfying to control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every asset was hand-crafted from paper, scanned into Photoshop, and then digitally arranged by our artists to build
            levels that matched our designs.
